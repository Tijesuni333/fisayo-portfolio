                    <h3>CONCEPT</h3>
                    <p>Folobuy is a Nigerian eCommerce website that specializes in the sales of Nigerian made items, ranging from clothing to furniture etc. </p>
                    <p>The campaign centred around brand activations, and launching of the Ecommerce website. </p>  
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>PLANNING</h3>
                    <p> The major goal of this campaign was to acquire vendors that woul register on the website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>We had to brainstorm on how we would achieve this using social media as the platform for this campaign.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>EXECUTION</h3>
                    <p>We first had to work on the content strategy because when people came to the social media pages, we wanted them to have an idea of our campaign goals. </p>
                    <p>We created a week-long content that resonated around the anticipation of the launch. 
                        When the campaign went live, We ran paid advertisement. Now we got our target audience through a method called customer personas. </p>
                    <p>Customer Personas are mockups of our ideal client and their pain points. 
                        This helped us dive deeply into the mind of our potential clients and was able to appropriately target them.</p>
                    <p>We created walkthroughs and demos on how to register and upload products on the website.</p>
