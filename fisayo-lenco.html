                    <h3>For Acquisition</h3>
                    <p>I made use of Paid acquisition. We were optimizing for speed but this was different from blitz scaling because it was completely Data Led. </p>
                    <p>I used Facebook and Instagram ads, Google for PPC and Youtube Ads, Linkedin and Twitter Ads. </p>
                    <p>I built out a customer persona for each of these channels. This helped me craft the right messaging targeting the right pain points.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>For Activation</h3>
                    <p> I looked at the data and sent email drips to customers that had not begun their onboarding and registration process. I used tools like customer io and google analytics to segment users based on where they were in the customer journey and this improved the activation rate by 30% week on week.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>For Retention</h3>
                    <p>I used mixed panel to study the behavior patterns of our users and created cohorts of users based on people that had dropped off and not used their accounts in 7, 14 and 28 days.</p>
                    <p>We used the same segmentation in the activation phase to attract them to come back to use their accounts. We saw a spike in retention when we did this.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>For Referral</h3>
                    <p> we did not want to pay people to use our platform so we encouraged user-generated content from our happiest customers.</p>
                    <p>This acted as a source of referral because people came into our funnel through the lovely reviews and content from our customers.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>For Revenue</h3>
                    <p>we exported a list of all our users and used paid marketing and email marketing to remind our users to use our platform and the benefits. This also increased the bottom line significantly.</p>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="end"> Through constant learning and iteration, I was able to constantly develop data-led marketing campaigns for Lenco Technologies.</p>
